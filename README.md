## Hello, I'm Ernesto Vera
I'm a <b>Computer Engineer</b> from Mexicali, Baja California, graduated in <b>2022</b> from <b>Universidad Aut√≥noma de Baja California (UABC)</b> and currently pursuing a masters in Science from UABC as well. I'm mostly interested in technology particularly in sensing platforms and embedded systems. I like learning new things as well as teaching. In my free time I like building fun projects.

### Tools
I like building my stuff in linux using mostly <b>vim</b> as my editor and the preffered build tools/interpreter for the language I'm writing (mostly CMake, make and Python).

I do not (yet) use Arch btw.
